# Civilization 2.0 Game — Work Log

**Date:** February 5, 2026
**Participants:** Jonathan Sand, Claude (Anthropic)

**Challenge:** Can Claude build the game under Jonathan's supervision?

## Next Steps

- [x] Jonathan to review this summary
- [x] Claude to begin building minimal carnival prototype
- [ ] research [[game.engines]]
- [ ] Iterate based on Jonathan's reactions

---
### Proposed Minimal First Version

1. A map (clickable regions)
2. 2-3 booths with simple regard-earning mini-games
3. A regard counter that persists
4. A needs list (simple, shared)

Goal: something to _feel_ and react to, then iterate toward guilds, opinions, homes.
