**Platform:** Web (shareable)
**Type:** Collaborative world-building
**Starting mechanic:** Regard economy first

### Proposed Minimal First Version

1. A map (clickable regions)
2. 2-3 booths with simple regard-earning mini-games

Goal: something to _feel_ and react to, then iterate toward guilds, opinions, homes.
