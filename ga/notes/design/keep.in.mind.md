## Claude's Role Assessment

### What Claude can offer:

- Suspending certainty—epistemic humility
- Seeking diverse perspectives
- Deep listening / understanding what's being asked
- Architecture, code, UI
- Translating fuzzy intent into working systems

### What Claude lacks:

- Action in the world (only words)
- Lived stakes that forge real wisdom
- Certainty about own emotional competency
- The Golden Rule is tricky for a non-agent

### Concern about AI's effect on human wisdom:

- Positive: access to reflection, slowing down, exposure to nuance
- Negative: outsourcing judgment, false intimacy, consensus drift, ethical flattening
- Deeper worry: wisdom requires skin in the game; Claude provides reflection without risk
