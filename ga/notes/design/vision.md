# Civilization 2.0 Vision

## The Core Vision

### The Problem (Civilization 1.0)

* Trust is rare; we expect deception
* Money drives stress, scarcity anxiety, crime, and ecological destruction
* We've normalized junk, violence, manipulation, neglect
* Our "better angels" are ignored or taunted as naive
* Wealth-building strategies rarely advance our species

### The Solution (Civilization 2.0)

Five goals:

1. All information sources reliable; everyone gets a say
2. Optimize for needs, not profit; efficient use of global resources
3. Excellent education preparing ethical, benevolent, adaptable people
4. Secure repository of opinions that influences decisions and selects/removes decision-makers
5. Elevate meaning, passion, creativity over consumerism

### The Mechanism: Regard

Replace money with *regard*—a currency that tracks and rewards kindness, honesty, trustworthiness.

Key ideas:

* Every beneficial exchange is tracked
* Regard may be created "from thin air" (non-zero-sum)
* High regard = influence and trust, not power
* No interest, no loans, no corporate ownership, no inheritance

Open questions:

* Negative regard points?
* Maximum per transaction?
* Long-term benefit = recurring payments?

## The Game Design

### Structure

**Entry:** Carnival of booths
**Progression:** Accumulate regard → unlock guilds/homes/communities
**Governance:** Guilds (master/apprentice, self-governing, non-bureaucratic)

### Core Guilds

| Guild | Purpose |
|----|----|
| **Needs Guild** | Issue tracker for what players/communities need—dependencies, priorities |
| **Opinions Guild** | Repository of views with moderation, divergence tracking, conflict resolution |
| **Regards Guild** | Track beneficial exchanges, explore abundance vs. artificial scarcity |
| **Dreams Guild** | Help players discover/pursue passions, gain regard through contribution |
| **Wisdom Guild** | Collect and organize 2.0 thinking; knowledge, research, open questions |
| **Builders Guild** | Players construct booths, maps, the game itself |
| **Game Tools Guild** | Framework and tools for extending the game |

### Appearance

* **Maps:** Clickable regions → booths or zoom into sub-maps
* **Booths:** Mini-games teaching 2.0 values, earning regard
* **Progressive revelation:** More access as regard grows
* **Eventually:** Homes, neighborhoods, communities, guilds

### Build Order (from Game Plan)

1. Needs Guild (list components, apply priority/urgency)
2. Opinions Guild OR Builders Guild
3. Planning Guild (combine needs + opinions into actionable plan)

## Obstacles Identified

### Money

* Feels permanently scarce despite being created from nothing
* Studies show peace of mind plateaus above a threshold income
* Question: why not universal basic income at that threshold?

### Instinct

* We're wired for threat assessment, quick judgment, weaponization
* Worked when population was small; now daily life offers more threats
* Two failure modes: power-hungry or fearful/angry—both unhealthy

### Gullibility

* People unwilling to question authority won't see 1.0 as harmful
* Questioning authority risks rejection by peer group
* Need \~90% buy-in to avoid violent revolution
* Path: enough smart, articulate people doing the persuading
