# Code Debt

offer a proposal for the first unchecked item


- [ ] steppers got centered in build notes, move back to top left
	- [ ] when only step down button is visible, it should leave empty space for step up, so it does not jump when the step up button appears
- [ ] 2D needs to be a "infinite zoom" projection
	- [ ] so rotated SO flatten but "retain their relative angle"
- [ ] pac: use hit target for ALL buttons and segments
---
- [ ] pac: in all code files, use 4-space tabs (not 2-)
- [ ] tweak dimensionals
	- [ ] tab between dimensionals
	- [ ] arrow-key nudging (±unit of precision)
- [ ] color inheritance
	- [ ] assign the color to the selected SO
	- [ ] make all children inherit the color of their parent

## Done
