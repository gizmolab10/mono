# Code Debt

offer a proposal for the first unchecked item

- [x] rename d smart object -> d attributes
- [x] d parts -> d assembly
- [x] new banner -> editor
- [x] assembly table -> v arrow keys change selection
- [ ] open library -> hesitation
- [ ] migrate to {o, e, l} from {x, X, w}
	- [ ] Axis -> rename gets (start -> origin and end -> extent)
	- [ ] regarding algebra, for the x axis, we have x, X and w. i am thinking of using axis-agnostic algebra: origin, extent, and length (o, e, l). propose version 8 migration
- [ ] save to local storage,  export to fs
- [ ] swap xy -> corrupted
- [ ] rotate 90° (+,-) (x,y,z)
- [ ] double height controls
- [ ] [[more milestones]]

- [ ] color inheritance
	- [ ] assign the color to the selected SO
	- [ ] make all children inherit the color of their parent
- [ ] trig rise and run
- [ ] tweak dimensionals
	- [ ] tab between dimensionals
	- [ ] arrow-key nudging (±unit of precision)
- [ ] tweak repeaters
	- [ ] diagonal bracing: angled member across stud bay
	- [ ] diagonal stud lengths (rake walls)
- [ ] [[three.dimensions]] revisit Intersection detection when object count grows

- [ ] use codegraph
- [ ] [great conversation with Pete](https://jonathan-and-pete-2026-02-19.peterkaminski.wiki/Conversation_Flow)
