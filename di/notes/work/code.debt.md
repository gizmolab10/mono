# Code Debt

offer a proposal for the first unchecked item

- [x] expand algebra with {s, e, l} contextual aliases
	- [x] s/e/l expand to concrete axis aliases based on owning attribute's axis
	- [ ] translate button bottom of attributes
		- [ ] between current and axis agnostic
- [ ] disallow algebraic names in constants
- [ ] ability to rotate around an axis
	- [ ] swap xy -> corrupted
	- [ ] rotate 90° (+,-) (x,y,z)
- [ ] double height controls
- [ ] dark accent -> **selected** button state change text to **white**
- [ ] library -- save to local storage, export to fs
- [ ] ability to stretch origins of root
	- [ ] do all children origins must be adjusted?
- [ ] [[more milestones]]

- [ ] color inheritance
	- [ ] assign the color to the selected SO
	- [ ] make all children inherit the color of their parent
- [ ] trig rise and run
- [ ] tweak dimensionals
	- [ ] tab between dimensionals
	- [ ] arrow-key nudging (±unit of precision)
- [ ] tweak repeaters
	- [ ] diagonal bracing: angled member across stud bay
	- [ ] diagonal stud lengths (rake walls)
- [ ] [[three.dimensions]] revisit Intersection detection when object count grows

---

- [ ] use codegraph
- [ ] [great conversation with Pete](https://jonathan-and-pete-2026-02-19.peterkaminski.wiki/Conversation_Flow)
- [ ] tmux terminal multiplexer
