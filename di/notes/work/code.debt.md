# Code Debt

offer a proposal for the first unchecked item

- [x] 2D needs to be a "infinite zoom" projection
	- [x] so rotated SO flatten but "retain their relative angle"
- [ ] add details hamburger
- [ ] pac: use hit target for ALL buttons and segments
---
- [ ] pac: in all code files, use 4-space tabs (not 2-)
- [ ] tweak dimensionals
	- [ ] tab between dimensionals
	- [ ] arrow-key nudging (±unit of precision)
- [ ] color inheritance
	- [ ] assign the color to the selected SO
	- [ ] make all children inherit the color of their parent
