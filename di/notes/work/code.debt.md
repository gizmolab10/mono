# Code Debt


offer a proposal for the first unchecked item


- [x] re-enable stretching origin (for any given axis) of root
	- [x] -> by adjusting length such that end remains fixed (for that axis)
	- [x] dragging the end point -- disallow making the length negative -> at the moment of length == 0, switch to dragging the start point
- [ ] the root face selection dots that are red -> blue
- [ ] ability to rotate around an axis
	- [ ] swap xy -> corrupted
	- [ ] rotate 90° (+,-) (x,y,z)
- [ ] disallow algebraic names in constants
- [ ] occluded dimensions !!!!!!!
- [ ] darker banners
- [ ] dark accent -> **selected** button state change text to **white**
- [ ] click on a selected SO in assembly -> unselects
---
- [ ] user-friendly formula error popup
- [ ] double height controls
- [ ] library -- save to local storage, export to fs
- [ ] [[more milestones]]

---

- [ ] color inheritance
	- [ ] assign the color to the selected SO
	- [ ] make all children inherit the color of their parent
- [ ] trig rise and run
- [ ] tweak dimensionals
	- [ ] tab between dimensionals
	- [ ] arrow-key nudging (±unit of precision)
- [ ] tweak repeaters
	- [ ] diagonal bracing: angled member across stud bay
	- [ ] diagonal stud lengths (rake walls)
- [ ] [[three.dimensions]] revisit Intersection detection when object count grows

---

- [ ] use codegraph
- [ ] [great conversation with Pete](https://jonathan-and-pete-2026-02-19.peterkaminski.wiki/Conversation_Flow)
- [ ] tmux terminal multiplexer
