# Code Debt


offer a proposal for the first unchecked item


- [x] always draw the root's bottom rect (faint stroke = grid's selected SO stroke)
- [ ] resizing the window makes the drawing blink a lot. surely it does NOT need to re-render, only shift what is already rendered?
- [x] straighten & orientation controls -> favor bottom at bottom OR front at bottom
- [x] select root SO on click a library item (replaces the root) AND on launch if nothing is currently selected
- [x] shrink to fit broken
	- [x] relaunch increases depth much farther than farthest SO
		- [x] fix: `set_bound` on compiled attrs stored absolute value; `get_bound` added parent offset again (double-count)
	- [ ] enhancements moved to [[7.edit.drags]] § Enhancements
- [ ] move all code debt done items to appropriate milestone
	- [ ] add it to an end section called work done
		- [ ] convert checkboxes to numbered bullet points
- [ ] work on [[rotation]]
	- [ ] manual test -- wacka.di
	- [ ] 24 straighten choices
- [ ] what went wrong with [[s3]]?
- [ ] write a claude forum article
- [ ] soda stream
- [ ] stairs have no fire blocks (button in selected part)
- [ ] design flaw: saving working project in a file -> cross talk
- [ ] disallow algebraic names in constants
- [ ] hide occluded dimensions !!!!!!!
- [ ] darker banners
- [ ] dark accent -> **selected** button state change text to **white**
- [ ] click on a selected SO in parts -> unselects

- [ ] user-friendly formula error popup
- [ ] double height controls
- [ ] library -- save to local storage, export to fs
- [ ] [[more milestones]]
