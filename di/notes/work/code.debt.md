# Code Debt

offer a proposal for the first unchecked item

- [x] add a toggle button to D_Selection titled "hide" / "show" -- hide means do not draw the SO or its decorations
- [x] add a margin 8px at right and left of both D_Selection tables
- [ ] [[separators]]
- [ ] use codegraph
---
- [ ] pac: in all code files, use tabs that are 4 (not 2) spaces
- [ ] tweak dimensionals
	- [ ] tab between dimensionals
	- [ ] arrow-key nudging (±unit of precision)
- [ ] color inheritance
	- [ ] assign the color to the selected SO
	- [ ] make all children inherit the color of their parent
- [ ] [[three.dimensions]] revisit Intersection detection when object count grows
