# Code Debt


offer a proposal for the first unchecked item


- [ ] display formulas with spaces between tokens (eg. ".l - front_th + dado")
- [ ] row span for root disallowed formulas and "s" values (they are always 0)
- [ ] drag -> disallow making the length negative
- [ ] ability to stretch origins of root
	- [ ] do all children origins must be adjusted?
- [ ] ability to rotate around an axis
	- [ ] swap xy -> corrupted
	- [ ] rotate 90° (+,-) (x,y,z)
- [ ] disallow algebraic names in constants
- [ ] occluded dimensions !!!!!!!
- [ ] user-friendly formula error popup
- [ ] double height controls
- [ ] dark accent -> **selected** button state change text to **white**
- [ ] click on a selected SO in assembly -> unselects
- [ ] library -- save to local storage, export to fs
- [ ] bring user manual up to date
- [ ] [[more milestones]]

- [ ] color inheritance
	- [ ] assign the color to the selected SO
