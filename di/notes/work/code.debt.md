# Code Debt

offer a proposal for the first unchecked item

- [ ] backward compatibility -- describe current design reading a file that is v1 → [migration.md](../architecture/core/migration.md)
- [ ] migrate to {s, e, l} from {x, X, w}
	- [ ] regarding algebra, for the x axis, we have x, X and w. i am thinking of using axis-agnostic algebra: origin, extent, and length (o, e, l). propose version 8 migration
- [ ] save to local storage,  export to fs
- [ ] [[more milestones]]

- [ ] color inheritance
	- [ ] assign the color to the selected SO
	- [ ] make all children inherit the color of their parent
- [ ] trig rise and run
- [ ] tweak dimensionals
	- [ ] tab between dimensionals
	- [ ] arrow-key nudging (±unit of precision)
- [ ] tweak repeaters
	- [ ] diagonal bracing: angled member across stud bay
	- [ ] diagonal stud lengths (rake walls)
- [ ] [[three.dimensions]] revisit Intersection detection when object count grows
