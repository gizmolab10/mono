# Milestone 5: Smart Objects
**Timeline:** Jan 29, 2025 | **Status:** in progress

## Goal

Introduce smart objects (SO) — geometry with attributes. The foundation for everything that follows: editing, dimensions, hierarchy.

## What Emerged

(add when complete)

## Our Work

### Define what a smart object is
- [x] How does it differ from O_Scene? SO is primary, O_Scene is optional ref for rendering
- [x] Should SO wrap O_Scene or replace it? Composition — O_Scene is ref in SO
- [x] What attributes does an SO have?

### Implement
- [x] Create `runtime/Smart_Object.ts` — extends Identifiable, has name + optional O_Scene
- [x] Create `types/Attribute.ts` — boilerplate for name/value pairs
- [x] Add attributes collection to Smart_Object
- [x] use SO to create the demo scene objects
- [x] Register SOs with hits manager
	- [x] faces (with front-facing detection)
	- [x] corners
	- [x] edges
- [x] Hover highlighting (red: dot for corner, line for edge, fill for face)

### Test
- [ ] Create a simple SO (rectangle? box?)
- [ ] Verify hit detection works
