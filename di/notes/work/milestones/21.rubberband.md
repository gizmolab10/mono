- [ ] i want to draw a rect (rubber band) which causes two adjustments:
	- [ ] rotation center to shift to the center of the rect
	- [ ] scale zooms in to bring the longer dim of the rect to exaactly fit the graph
- [ ] a controls. button to recenter
- [ ] command drag moves the rotation center such that the render "follows" the mouse
