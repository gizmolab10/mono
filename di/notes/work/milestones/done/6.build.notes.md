# Milestone 6 — Build Notes
**Timeline:** Feb 2–4, 2026 | **Status:** done

Track what gets built, when, and why.

## Goal

Capture daily/weekly progress in a structured way — what changed, decisions made, blockers hit.

- [x] add steppers and close button
- [x] make build button EXACTLY like the one in ws
- [x] increase the corner radius of overlay

## Format

Each entry:
- **Date** bold at top
- What was done (bullet list)
- Decisions or trade-offs
- Blockers or open questions

## Enhancements


- [x] steppers got centered in build notes, move back to top left
  - [x] when only step down button is visible, it should leave empty space for step up, so it does not jump when the step up button appears
- [x] when build notes overlay is visible, make entire app just one large empty div, retaining the wraparound accent gap
