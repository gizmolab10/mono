# Work

- [x] i want to explore projects
- [ ] proposal for converting my guide files into skills
  - skills are triggers, not replacements — they READ guide files, not inline them
  - guide files in `notes/guides/` stay as source of truth
  - use `.claude/commands/` (project-local, in repo, git-tracked) NOT `~/.claude/commands/`
  - keep always.md, keywords.md in CLAUDE.md (always-on guards — must fire every response)
  - do NOT convert pre-flight gates (always.md, pitfalls.md) — they need to be automatic
  - convert navigational shorthands to skills: `/cd`, `/revisit-di`, `/revisit-ws`
  - each skill is a `.md` file whose contents become the prompt when invoked
  - example: `mono/.claude/commands/cd.md` → `Read ~/GitHub/mono/di/notes/work/code.debt.md and propose the first unchecked item.`
