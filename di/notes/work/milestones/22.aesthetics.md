i want a beautiful and exciting user experience

- [x] add a color picker
- [x] move precision and units to details
- [x] add a slider to details for line thickness
- [x] make the height of units system button consistent with other buttons
- [x] hide face label when face is
  - [x] occluded
  - [x] nearly edge on
- [x] convert precision into a segmented control whose segment titles depend on the units system
  - [x] imperial: whole, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64
  - [x] others: whole, 1, 2, 3
  - [x] constrain the SOT values accordingly
- [x] **face intersection** line segments
  - [x] **only** for SO pairs that do not share ALL their axes
  - [x] **ASSUME**:
    - [x] child does not share axes
    - [x] child extends outside parent
    - [x] **create from reset**: add child, stretch child longer than parent, rotate child
  - [x] compute the **dihedral** intersection line for each pair of intersecting faces (use cross product)
  - [x] **compute the two endpoints** of each such line
  - [x] hidden lines, etc
    - [x] i want the rendered lines to exclude anything that is "inside" any SO
  - [x] screen-space spatial partitioning (tiled bins or BVH) to cull face checks per edge
    - [x] Occlusion is brute-force O(edges × faces) — every edge checks every front-facing face from every other object. Intersection lines add O(face_pairs × faces) on top. Fine for a handful of objects, but will choke at scale
    - [x] [[spatial]]
- [x] 2D needs to be a "infinite zoom" projection
  - [x] so rotated SO flatten but "retain their relative angle"
- [x] add ability to edit face label
- [x] remove border around edit input fields in the canvas
- [x] row of SO buttons -> top center of canvas
  - [x] selected SO needs a border, black text, darker background color
  - [x] unselected need light background color
- [x] move breadcrumbs -> graph left corner
	- [x] stack them vertically
- [ ] convert sep div into a svelte component
	- [ ] optional title
	- [ ] horizontal or vertical
	- [ ] adjustable thickness, length, radius of flare
	- [ ] optional click handler function
