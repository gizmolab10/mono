# Code Debt --- Done

- [x] selecting often fails
- [x] rename test -> hit_test
- [x] convert Stores into a class
- [x] ability to export/import to/from file
- [x] new children spontaneously appear
- [x] steppers hop up and down in build notes
- [x] convert Orientation functions into a class
- [x] SO should use its internal id for hierarchy/formulas
- [x] add child should apply to current selection
  - [x] **bug:** click on button -> selects root
- [x] add new child -> wrong dimensions
  - [x] algorithm: using smallest length of parent, divide that in half, use that for all dimensions
  - [x] assure that the child axes all align with the parent's axes
  - [x] after adding, select the parent
- [x] cruft
  - [x] consolidate redundancy
  - [x] simplify over-engineering
  - [x] remove inconsistencies
  - [x] ameliorate structural risks
- [x] delete selected SO
- [x] hover/click should hit the front most SO
- [x] hide occluded dimensionals
- [x] performance analysis -- app is VERY unresponsive
- [x] build number button -> bottom left of canvas
- [x] remove "Details" label from details
- [x] background color picker -> details same row as edge color, and make it the left most
- [x] add details hamburger (copy from ws project)
- [x] use hit target for ALL buttons and segments
- [x] research scene model
- [x]  move all Angle and Polar code from Coordinates to Angle
  - [x] including thin delegates
- [x] pac: combine all *\*Rect* interfaces
- [x] find all the build numbers (milestones) and dates -> build notes
- [x] rebuild SO with 2 single-axis rotations
  - [x] from which, quaternion is derived
- [x] **ABANDON:** see through -> all, add "back"
- [x] organize architecture notes
- [x] version 4: attr serial -> orig, ext, len, angle
- [x] interpretation -> wait until approved
- [x] delete -> delete selected AND its entire subtree of SO
- [x] integrate \[\[simplicity\]\] -> \[\[workflow\]\]
- [x] \[\[17.library\]\]
- [x] get claude vscode == plugin
- [x] tumble ALWAYS applies to root SO
  - [x] OPTION tumble -> applies to selected SO
- [x] values in attr tables should be offsets, not absolutes
- [x] choose an SO (buttons at top of graph) -> select most front facing face
  - [x] as root tumbles -> update selection to select (possibly different) most front facing face
- [x] save button should use SO's name for file name
- [x] remove all children button should also remove all sd constants that are no longer referenced
- [x] rename standard dimensions -> user constants
- [x] not all user constants got removed by delete all children
  - [x] verify that those that remain are NOT referenced !!! but do NOT remove them
  - [x] debug delete all children
- [x] hover -> enabled cells
- [x] pac: in all code files, use tabs that are 4 (not 2) spaces
- [x] show computed count (not funky equation)
- [x] segmented control attributes / repeater (only appears for repeaters or on clicking repeat)
- [x] when resizing root change = 2 times mouse drag
- [x] change "selection" to "smart object" and D_Selection -> D_Smart_Object
- [x] move instructions (above) for configuring repeaters -> mono/di/notes/user manual/repeaters.md
- [x] rename list -> hierarchy
- [x] backward compatibility -- describe current design reading a file that is v1 → [[di/notes/architecture/core/migration|migration
- [x] preferences
	- [x] move units system button to top far right
	- [x] move reset button to bottom right
	- [x] separator directly above line thickness slider
- [x] red dots for occluded and disabled
- [x] set_invariant synced length from raw .value instead of get_bound(), corrupting child SO geometry
	- [x] BUG: open the drawer from the library. selected the front SO. click the cross box in row d. the correct formula appeared (Y - y) with the formula for Y blanked, the values unchanged. the drawing looked fine. THEN, check the cross box in row Y. the value for y changed (to a large negative number, and the value for Y to an even larger negative number) and the drawing not so nice. explain
- [x] row span for root disallowed formulas and "s" values (they are always 0)
- [x] details rename banners -> parts, selected parts (from assembly and selection)
- [x] re-enable stretching origin (for any given axis) of root
	- [x] -> by adjusting length such that end remains fixed (for that axis)
	- [x] dragging the end point -- disallow making the length negative -> at the moment of length == 0, switch to dragging the start point
- [x] the root face selection dots that are red -> blue
- [x] cannot insert stretch into a new SO
	- [x] was working
	- [x] click + in library banner
	- [x] option click on stretch in library
	- [x] red dots appear on hover over nothing
	- [x] relaunch stretch appears
- [x] always draw the root's bottom rect (faint stroke = grid's selected SO stroke)
- [x] resizing the window makes the drawing blink a lot. surely it does NOT need to re-render, only shift what is already rendered?
- [x] straighten & orientation controls -> favor bottom at bottom OR front at bottom
- [x] select root SO on click a library item (replaces the root) AND on launch if nothing is currently selected
- [x] shrink to fit broken
	- [x] relaunch increases depth much farther than farthest SO
		- [x] fix: `set_bound` on compiled attrs stored absolute value; `get_bound` added parent offset again (double-count)
	- [x] enhancements moved to [[7.edit.drags]] § Enhancements
