# Search

When you've got hundreds of items, clicking around isn't enough. You need to find things fast.

## The Search Box

Look for it in Controls. Type, and results appear instantly — no submit button, no waiting.

Search matches against:
- Item names
- Field values (depending on setup)
- Tags

Partial matches work. "proj" finds "Project Alpha" and "My Big Project."

## Results

Matches show as a list. Click one to:
- Select it
- Navigate to it (it becomes visible in the graph)
- Optionally make it the focus

The graph jumps to show your result in context. You're not just finding it — you're going there.

## Filtering vs Searching

**Search** = find a specific item by name or content. One-shot. You get there and you're done.

**Filter** = narrow down what's visible. Ongoing. The graph shows only items that match your criteria.

Some setups have both. Some have only search. Check your Controls for filter options.

## Filter by Tag

If your setup supports filtering:
1. Open the filter panel
2. Select one or more tags
3. Graph shows only items with those tags (and their ancestors, so context is preserved)

Clear the filter to see everything again.

## Filter by Field

Some setups let you filter on field values:
- "Show only items where Status = Done"
- "Show only items created this week"

This depends on your schema and configuration.

## Highlighting vs Hiding

Two approaches to filtering:

**Highlight mode** — everything shows, but matches are emphasized. Non-matches fade.

**Hide mode** — non-matches disappear entirely. The graph shrinks to just what matters.

Which one you get depends on setup. Some let you toggle between them.

## Keyboard Shortcut

Usually Cmd+F (Mac) or Ctrl+F (Windows) opens search. Check your Controls for the exact shortcut in your setup.

Start typing immediately — focus lands in the search box.

## Clearing

Clear the search box to dismiss results and return to normal view. The graph snaps back to where you were, or stays on the last result — depends on configuration.
