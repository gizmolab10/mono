# Import/Export

Getting data in and out of Webseriously.

## Export

### JSON

The native format. Exports your entire hierarchy with all fields, tags, and metadata intact. Use this for:
- Backups
- Moving data between Webseriously instances
- Processing with other tools

Find it in Controls or a menu. Click, and your browser downloads a `.json` file.

### CSV

Flat format. Good for spreadsheets. Each row is an item, columns are fields.

The tricky part: hierarchy. CSV is flat, but your data has parents and children. Webseriously handles this by including a "parent" column (usually the parent's ID or path).

Use CSV when you need to:
- Edit in Excel or Google Sheets
- Share with someone who doesn't use Webseriously
- Do bulk data entry (edit in a spreadsheet, re-import)

### PDF

A snapshot of the graph as it currently looks. Not editable, but good for:
- Sharing a visual overview
- Printing
- Archiving a moment in time

The PDF captures the current view — whatever mode you're in, whatever's expanded or collapsed. What you see is what you get.

## Import

### JSON

Drop a Webseriously JSON file back in, and it rebuilds the whole structure. Fields, tags, relationships — all restored.

**Warning:** importing usually replaces or merges with existing data. Check your setup for how conflicts are handled. Some setups ask, some overwrite, some merge.

### CSV

Import from spreadsheet format. You'll need:
- A column for item names
- A column indicating parent relationships
- Columns for any fields you want populated

The exact format depends on your schema. Some setups offer a mapping step — "which column is the name? which is the parent?" Others expect a specific format.

### Drag and Drop

Some setups support dragging a file directly onto the graph. The file gets parsed and items appear. Quick and casual.

## Partial Export

Sometimes you don't want everything — just one branch.

Select an item, then export. Some setups export only that item and its descendants. Others always export the whole tree. Check your Controls for options.

## Where Does Data Live?

This matters for import/export:

**Browser storage** — data lives in your browser's localStorage. Export is your only backup. If you clear browser data, it's gone.

**Firebase / Airtable / etc** — data lives in the cloud. Export is still useful for backups or migration, but the canonical copy is online.

**Bubble plugin** — data lives in your Bubble database. Webseriously is just a view. Export gives you a snapshot, but the source of truth is Bubble.

Know which one you're using. It affects what import/export means for you.
