# The Graph

This is where you live. The big canvas on the right. Everything else exists to support what happens here.

## Two Modes

### Tree Mode

Classic hierarchy. Parent above, children below (or parent left, children right — depends on orientation settings).

Good for:
- Seeing the whole structure at once
- Understanding depth and breadth
- Traditional org-chart thinking

The downside: deep trees get cramped. Wide trees sprawl. You're always fighting for space.

### Radial Mode

Focus item sits at the center. Children orbit in rings around it. The further out, the deeper the nesting.

Good for:
- Exploring one branch intensely
- Keeping context tight
- Feeling like you're "inside" the data

The magic here is paging. When a ring has too many items to display comfortably, it shows a page at a time. Arrows let you flip through. No cramming.

## Navigation

### Pan

Drag the background to slide the view around. Works in both modes.

### Zoom

Scroll wheel zooms in and out. Pinch on trackpad works too.

### Rotate (Radial Only)

Drag the background in radial mode and the whole graph spins. Useful for bringing a particular branch to the top or side.

### Dive In

Double-click any item to make it the new focus. The view reorganizes around it. This is how you explore depth — not by scrolling, but by refocusing.

### Surface Back

Your ancestors form a breadcrumb trail. Click any of them to pop back up. Or use the back button in Controls.

## Visual Cues

### Selection

Selected items have a distinct highlight. One item at a time (unless you're rubberbanding — more on that later).

### Hover

Hover shows a softer highlight. Preview without commitment.

### Depth

In radial mode, items further from center are visually lighter — alpha fades with depth. Keeps the focus area punchy, periphery quiet.

### Connections

Lines connect parents to children. In tree mode, they're straight or elbowed. In radial mode, they curve gracefully.

## Paging (Radial Mode)

When a cluster has more items than fit comfortably, paging kicks in.

- Left/right arrows appear at the cluster edges
- Click to flip through pages
- The current page indicator shows where you are

This keeps radial mode usable even with hundreds of items. No overlap, no chaos — just one page at a time.

## Clusters

In radial mode, children group into three clusters around the focus:
- **Left** — typically siblings or peers
- **Right** — typically siblings or peers
- **Bottom** — typically the main children

The exact arrangement depends on your data and settings. Point is: items don't just scatter randomly. They cluster with intention.
