# What is Webseriously?

i built Webseriously because i was drowning in lists. Todo apps, note apps, spreadsheets — all flat. But my thoughts aren't flat. They branch, nest, connect. i needed something that could show me the shape of my thinking.

## The Idea

Webseriously is a visual way to work with hierarchical data. Instead of endless scrolling through nested bullet points, you see your information as a living graph — a tree that branches out, or a radial map with rings expanding from a center.

Click something, and it becomes the focus. Its children fan out around it. Its parents trail behind as breadcrumbs. You're always looking at one thing and its immediate context.

## Who It's For

- **Thinkers** who structure ideas before writing
- **Planners** who break big goals into nested tasks
- **Organizers** who need to see relationships, not just lists
- **Anyone** tired of collapsing and expanding outlines

If you've ever wished you could zoom into one branch of your notes and forget the rest exists — this is that.

## Two Ways to Use It

**Standalone app** — visit the site, start creating. Your data lives in your browser (or connects to Firebase, Airtable, etc).

**Bubble plugin** — embed Webseriously inside a Bubble.io app. Your Bubble data flows in, you visualize and edit it, changes flow back.

Same tool, different contexts.

## What You'll See

Three regions:

- **Controls** (top) — buttons to switch modes, adjust settings
- **Details** (left) — info about whatever you've selected
- **Graph** (main area) — the visual map of your stuff

That's it. One screen. Everything unfolds from there.
