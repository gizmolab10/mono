# Working with Items

Items are the atoms of Webseriously. Everything you see in the graph is an item. Every item has a parent (except the root) and can have children.

## Creating Items

### Add a Child

1. Select an item
2. Click "Add" in the Details panel (or use keyboard shortcut)
3. New item appears as a child of the selected one

The new item is selected automatically, ready for you to name it.

### Add a Sibling

Some setups let you add a sibling — a new item at the same level as the selected one, sharing its parent. Check your Details panel for this option.

## Editing Items

### The Name

Click the item's label to edit inline. Or use the Details panel for a proper text field.

Names can be anything. Short is better for visual clarity, but you do you.

### Other Data

Items can carry more than just a name. Depending on your setup:
- **Fields** — custom data (dates, numbers, text)
- **Tags** — labels for categorization
- **Traits** — special properties that affect behavior

All of this lives in the Details panel when an item is selected.

## Deleting Items

Select an item, find the delete action in Details. Confirm.

**Warning:** Deleting an item deletes its children too. The whole branch goes. There's no undo (yet), so be sure.

## Rearranging

### Drag and Drop

Grab an item and drag it to a new parent. Drop it on the target, and it becomes a child of that item.

This is the main way to restructure your hierarchy. Faster than cut/paste, more intuitive than menu options.

### Reordering Siblings

Within a parent, you can drag to reorder children. The order affects how they display in the graph.

## Multi-Select

### Rubberband Selection

Click and drag on the background (not on an item) to draw a selection rectangle. Everything inside gets selected.

With multiple items selected, you can:
- Delete them all at once
- Move them together (drag the group)
- Apply bulk actions (if available)

### Shift-Click

Click one item, then shift-click another. Both are now selected (and everything in between, depending on context).

## Parent-Child Relationships

Every item (except root) has exactly one parent. An item can have zero or many children.

This is strict hierarchy — no item can have two parents. If you need that, you're looking for tags or links, not parent-child relationships.

### Changing Parents

Drag an item to a new parent. That's it. The item keeps its children — the whole subtree moves together.

### Orphans

If you delete a parent without its children... actually, you can't. Children go with the parent. No orphans allowed.
