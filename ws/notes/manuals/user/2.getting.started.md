# Getting Started

First time? Here's how to get oriented.

## The Screen

When you open Webseriously, you see three regions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Controls                        │
├───────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┤
│               │                                     │
│    Details    │              Graph                  │
│   (sidebar)   │         (the main event)            │
│               │                                     │
└───────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Controls** — mode switches, view options, the toolbar
- **Details** — info about whatever's selected, tabbed panels
- **Graph** — your data, visualized

Most of your time is spent in the graph. The other two are support.

## Your First Item

If you're starting fresh, you'll see a single root item. That's your permanent starting point. Everything else branches from it.

To create a child:
1. Select the root (click it)
2. Use the keyboard shortcut (SPACE), or the "add" action in Details.

Your new item, "idea", appears as a child of whatever was selected, ready for you to edit it.

## Selecting Things

**Click** — select one item. Details panel shows its info.

**Hover** — preview. The item highlights, but doesn't select.

**Double-click** — dive in. That item becomes the new focus, its children fan out around it.

**Long-click** — context actions (varies by setup).

## Moving Around

**Drag the background** — pan the view.

**Scroll wheel** — zoom in/out.

**In radial mode**, dragging rotates the whole graph. Feels like spinning a record.

## The Focus

There's always a "focus" item — the center of attention. In tree mode, it's the trunk. In radial mode, it's literally at the center.

When you double-click something, it becomes the focus. The view reorganizes around it. Its children spread out. Its ancestors become a breadcrumb trail.

This is the core interaction: dive deeper, surface back up. Like navigating folders, but visual.

## Modes

Two main views:

**Tree mode** — classic org chart. Parent at top (or left), children below (or right). Good for seeing the whole structure.

**Radial mode** — focus at center, children in rings around it. Good for exploring one branch at a time.

Switch between them in Controls. Your data doesn't change — just how you're looking at it.

## Next Steps

Once you've got items and can navigate, you'll want to:
- Edit item details (names, data, tags)
- Rearrange the hierarchy (drag and drop)
- Search and filter
- Export your work
