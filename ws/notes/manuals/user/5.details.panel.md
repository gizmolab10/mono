# Details Panel

The left sidebar. When you select an item, this is where you see and edit its guts.

## Tabs

The panel is organized into tabs. Not all tabs appear in all setups — depends on how Webseriously is configured.

### Actions

Buttons for things you can do to the selected item:
- **Add** — create a child
- **Delete** — remove this item (and its children)
- **Collapse/Expand** — hide or show children in the graph

Some setups add custom actions here too.

### Data

The item's fields. At minimum, there's a name. Beyond that, it depends on your schema:
- Text fields
- Numbers
- Dates
- Dropdowns
- Checkboxes

Edit directly. Changes save automatically (or on blur, depending on setup).

### Tags

Labels you can attach to items. Good for cross-cutting categorization — things that don't fit the hierarchy.

Click to add tags. Click again to remove. Search to find existing tags.

Tags are flat — no hierarchy. One item can have many tags. One tag can apply to many items.

### Traits

Special properties that affect how the item behaves or displays.

Examples:
- **Locked** — can't be edited or moved
- **Hidden** — doesn't show in graph
- **Starred** — gets a visual indicator

Traits are toggles — on or off.

### Preferences

Per-item display settings. Override the global defaults for just this item.

Examples:
- Custom color
- Collapsed by default
- Different label format

Not every item needs custom preferences. Most inherit from their parent or from global settings.

## When Nothing is Selected

If you click empty space and deselect everything, the Details panel shows global info:
- Database status
- Total item count
- Maybe a welcome message or tips

## Resizing

Drag the separator between Details and Graph to resize the panel. Make it narrower for more graph space. Make it wider if you're doing heavy editing.

Some setups let you collapse the panel entirely — a toggle in Controls or a keyboard shortcut.

## Context Sensitivity

The panel updates instantly as you select different items. No save button, no explicit refresh. Click something, see its details. Click something else, see those instead.

This is the whole point: the graph is for navigating, the panel is for inspecting and editing. Two tools, one workflow.
