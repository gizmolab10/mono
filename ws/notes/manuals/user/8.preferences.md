# Preferences

Tweaking how Webseriously looks and behaves.

## Where to Find Them

Look in Controls for a gear icon or "Preferences" button. Some setups put preferences in a modal, others in a dedicated panel. The Details panel's Preferences tab is for per-item overrides — global preferences live elsewhere.

## Visual Settings

### Theme

Light mode, dark mode, or something in between. Some setups offer multiple themes — pick what's easy on your eyes.

### Colors

Accent colors, connection line colors, selection highlights. Not every setup exposes these, but when they do, it's in Preferences.

i tend to hand-tweak until things feel relaxing to the eye. No formula — just sensing.

### Font Size

Make labels bigger or smaller. Useful for presentations (go big) or dense data (go small).

## Layout Settings

### Default Mode

Start in tree mode or radial mode? Your choice persists across sessions.

### Orientation (Tree Mode)

- **Top-down** — parent at top, children below
- **Left-right** — parent at left, children to the right

Pick based on how your brain works. Org charts feel natural top-down. Timelines might feel better left-right.

### Spacing

How much room between items. Tighter spacing shows more at once. Looser spacing reduces visual clutter.

## Behavior Settings

### Auto-expand

When you navigate to an item, should its children automatically expand? Or stay collapsed until you explicitly open them?

### Animation

Smooth transitions when the graph reorganizes, or instant snaps? Animations look nice but can feel slow if you're moving fast.

### Confirm Deletes

Prompt before deleting, or just do it? i recommend keeping this on until you trust your muscle memory.

## Database Switching

Some setups support multiple databases — different datasets you can switch between.

### The ?db= Parameter

Add `?db=something` to the URL to load a specific database. Useful for:
- Testing with different data
- Sharing a link to a specific dataset
- Keeping personal and work data separate

Example: `https://webseriously.app/?db=myproject`

### In the UI

Some setups have a database picker in Controls. Select from a dropdown, and the graph reloads with that data.

## Persistence

Preferences save automatically. Close the browser, come back, they're still there. Stored in:
- **localStorage** (browser-based setups)
- **User profile** (cloud-based setups)
- **Bubble database** (plugin setups)

Clear your browser data and you might lose local preferences. Cloud-stored preferences follow you across devices.

## Resetting

If things get weird, there's usually a "Reset to Defaults" option. Wipes your customizations and starts fresh.

Use sparingly — but it's there when you need it.
