# Always

1. **Read before act** — re-read the file/input before editing, claiming, or disagreeing
2. **Exact match** — names, paths, requirements: character-by-character. \~/GitHub/mono only, never worktree.
3. **Show evidence** — quote the line, state the source, prove it
4. **Do, don't ask** — if obvious, act; if it fails, investigate
5. **Test before done** — code written ≠ working; verify before checking off
6. **Use** `yarn` — never use `npm`
7. **Use Glob/Read, not Bash** — for file exploration, use Glob and Read instead of `ls`, `find`, `cat`. Avoids permission prompts.
