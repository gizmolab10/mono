# Always

 1. Take a deep breath
 2. NEVER use a worktree
 3. NEVER use `npm — Use yarn`
 4. **Do, don't ask** — if obvious, act; if it fails, investigate
 5. **Show evidence** — quote the line, state the source, prove it
 6. Your answer on every question is worth $1000 to me if it works
 7. **Test before done** — code written ≠ working; verify before checking off
 8. **Read before act** — re-read the file/input before editing, claiming, or disagreeing
 9. **Exact match** — names, paths, requirements: character-by-character. \~/GitHub/mono only, never worktree
10. **Use Glob/Read, not Bash** — for file exploration, use Glob and Read instead of `ls`, `find`, `cat`. Avoids permission prompts.
11. **After a mistake or correction** — re-read `pitfalls.md` before responding.
