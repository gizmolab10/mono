# Kinds of Tasks

Task types and which guides to read before starting. Collaborator will declare one or more of these, assess and state conflicts and update the column below.

| Kind | Guides | Notes | Conflicts |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| refactor | refactoring.md | STOP/SEARCH/LIST/WAIT | |
| migrate | migration.md, refactoring.md | phased, keep app working | refactoring wants search-per-change; migration bundles changes — search at phase boundaries |
| debug | test/debugging.md | hypotheses, verify source | |
| style check | style.md | naming, ordering, alignment | |
| layout | aesthetics.md, css.md | separators, fillets, toggles | |
| docs | markdown.md | anchors, problem/goal inline | |
| prose | voice.md | first person, casual, punchy | docs wants structure; prose wants flow — favor flow, add structure only if needed |
| journal | journals.md | chronological, bold dates | tidy removes clutter; journal preserves history — don't tidy the journal |
| tidy | workflow.md#tidying-up | reduce duplication, find homes | |
| implement | chat.md#implementation-discipline | quote plan, one change at a time | |
| multi-file | chat.md | search ALL files first, list scope | |
