# Style

Code and naming conventions. Customize for your stack.

## Why This Matters

Without style guidance, Claude makes reasonable guesses that might not match your codebase. You end up fixing formatting, renaming variables, adjusting patterns.

With style guidance, Claude's output drops into your code with minimal friction.

## What to Include

- **Naming conventions** — camelCase? snake_case? Prefixes for types?
- **Formatting** — Tabs or spaces? Quote style? Line length?
- **Patterns** — How you structure components, modules, tests
- **File organization** — Where things go

## How to Build This

1. Start with the basics (naming, formatting)
2. When Claude produces code that needs adjustment, note the pattern
3. Add it here
4. Repeat

This file grows as you encounter friction.
