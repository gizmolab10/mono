# Voice

How you want Claude to write. Customize this to match your style.

## Example Preferences

These are just examples — replace with your own:

- **Casual or formal?** — "Write like we're talking over coffee" vs "Keep it professional"
- **First person?** — "I built this" vs "The system was built"
- **Concise or detailed?** — "Short and punchy" vs "Thorough explanations"
- **Problem-first?** — Start with what's broken, then the fix

## Why This Matters

Without voice guidance, Claude defaults to generic technical writing. Bland, correct, forgettable.

With voice guidance, output sounds like *you*. Docs stay consistent. Less editing.

## How to Build This

1. Start empty
2. When Claude writes something that doesn't sound right, note what's off
3. Add a rule: "Don't do X" or "Do Y instead"
4. Repeat

Over time, this file captures your writing DNA.
