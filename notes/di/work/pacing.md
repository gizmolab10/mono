# Pacing

This project moves differently than webseriously. Not just faster — *easier*. And that difference has taught me something about how I work best.

## Why it flows

The patterns are borrowed from ws, not reinvented. The AI collaboration has persistent context through CLAUDE.MD. Documentation happens as I go, not as afterthought. When I say "full monte," I get it — no shortcuts that create debt later.

So there's less friction. Less second-guessing. More certainty when I move.

## Dream Out Loud

Here's what surprised me: the gap between thinking something and seeing it realized has collapsed. Say it, see it. Thirty seconds from idea to artifact.

It's like a lucid dream where you reshape the world as fast as you can imagine it. Energizing. Almost addictive.

But the real gift isn't the speed — it's what the speed *creates*. Because I'm not depleted by grunt work, I have capacity for the interesting problems. Because implementation doesn't slip away while I'm wrestling with boilerplate, I can stay at the right altitude — thinking about *what* and *why*.

And paradoxically, going faster gives me *more* room, not less. Ideas can settle. They have space to grow. I'm not rushing to implement before I forget what I meant.

There's a creative tension here, held comfortably — fast enough to keep momentum, slow enough for ideas to ripen. I feel fertile. Generative rather than depleted.

It's nice.
