# How to Write an Article
**Example:** AI Workflow for Developers
**Started:** 2026-01-06  
**Status:** Phase 3 in progress

## Problem

Most developers use AI as a fancy search engine — one-off questions, copy-paste answers, no accumulated context. The AI forgets everything between sessions. You end up re-explaining your codebase, your preferences, your patterns. Every. Single. Time.

## Goal

A Medium article that shows developers a different approach: treating AI as a collaborative partner with institutional memory. The workflow system you've built — CLAUDE.MD bootstrapping, living guides, work tracking with revisit points.

## Audience

Software developers who:
- Already use AI (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude) but feel friction
- Want more than autocomplete or Q&A
- Are open to changing their workflow, not just their tools

## Angle

Not "here's a cool prompt." Instead: "here's a system that compounds."

## Phase 1: Outline
- [x] Identify the hook (what grabs attention) ✅
- [x] List the key concepts to cover ✅
- [x] Decide on structure ✅
- [x] Draft outline with section headers ✅

### Outline

**Title:** I Accidentally Built a Junior Programmer

**Subtitle:** How a pile of markdown files turned AI into a real collaborator

1. **The Accident** — hook + origin story
2. **The Bootstrap File** — CLAUDE.MD as entry point
3. **Living Guides** — patterns AI applies without being told
4. **Work Tracking** — revisit points that survive sessions
5. **The Dynamic Shift** — trust + course-correct
6. **What AI Is Good At** — and what you still do
7. **Try It Yourself** — practical takeaway

## Phase 2: Draft
- [x] Write intro/hook ✅
- [x] Write body sections ✅
- [x] Write conclusion/call-to-action ✅
- [x] Include code/file examples where useful ✅

**Drafts:**
- [accidental.programmer.md](./accidental.programmer.md) — journey/emotion (Part 1)
- [how.to.build.it.md](./how.to.build.it.md) — practical guide (Part 2)

## Phase 3: Polish
- [ ] Tighten prose (voice.md rules)
- [ ] Check flow between sections
- [ ] Add any diagrams or visuals needed
- [ ] Final read-through

## Next Action
**Phase 3:** Review draft, tighten prose, check flow
