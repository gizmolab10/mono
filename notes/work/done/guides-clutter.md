# Working Minimum
**Started:** 2025-01-14  
**Status:** Thinking out loud

## Problem
The collaborate guides (chat, workflow, voice, evolve) have grown organically. They capture something real but may have redundancy, unclear boundaries, or missing connections. The mental model in chat.md is fresh — how does it relate to the rest?

## Goal
A clear, minimal set of guides that curate the collaboration model. Each file has a distinct purpose. No overlap. The mental model sits at the center.

## Questions to explore

- What's the core insight in the mental model?
- How do chat.md and workflow.md differ? What belongs where?
- Does voice.md belong here or is it about output style, not collaboration?
- What is evolve.md even doing?
- What's the minimum set of files that captures the essence?
