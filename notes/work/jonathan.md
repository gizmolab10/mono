# me — Jonathan's Space

Personal project for ideas, research, creative exploration.

## What It Is

A third mono project alongside ws and di. Not code-focused like ws. A place for:

- Ideas that don't fit elsewhere
- Research threads worth following
- Half-baked concepts worth fleshing out
- Crazy, creative, curious, cognitive stuff

## Structure

```
mono/
├── ws/           # webseriously (graph viz)
├── di/           # design intuition (CAD)
└── me/           # jonathan's space (ideas)
    ├── CLAUDE.MD
	└── notes/
	    ├── ideas/
	    ├── research/
	    └── ...
```

Navigation: `go me` works like `go ws` or `go di`.

This is about as far as i got with [personas](notes/work/next/personas.md).

## Maybe Later

- [ ] GitHub repo (separate from mono? or mono subfolder?)
- [ ] Netlify deployment (static site for public-facing pieces?)
- [ ] Hub app integration (third project in the hub alongside ws/di)

## CLAUDE.MD Draft

```markdown
# me — Jonathan's Space

> Ideas, research, creative exploration. Not code — concepts.

## What This Is

Personal sandbox. Collecting, researching, fleshing out ideas. Some wild, some practical. The throughline: curiosity.

## How to Work Here

READ before proposing. SEARCH before claiming nothing exists.

Ideas live in `ideas/`. Research in `research/`. Structure emerges as needed — don't over-organize early.

## Tone

Casual. First person. Short sentences. Let ideas breathe.

## Defaults

No code unless an idea demands it. No deadlines. No deliverables. Just exploration.
```

## Open Questions

1. Folder structure — start minimal (`ideas/`, `research/`) or let it emerge?
2. File format — markdown only, or allow other formats?
3. Public/private — any of this meant to be shared, or all private drafts?
4. Hub integration — what would me look like in the hub app? A third nav item? A different kind of view?

Ready to create the actual `me/` folder and CLAUDE.MD when you give the word.
