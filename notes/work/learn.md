# Learn

Collaborator errors → distilled into guide updates. It's a step in our roadmap for improvement

## Process

as we roll along, we hit a lot of bumps. i've noticed that i get fed up and stop dead. clean house. takes time. need a better triage system. Let's start with:

* [ ] list mistakes as they happen (oldest last)
	* [ ] hyphen-N date title
* [ ] distill: identify pattern, write rule, add to guide
* [ ] research: better tools, clever ideas
- [ ] track for escalating need:
	* [ ] fed up
	- [ ] stop dead
	- [ ] clean house

**To distill an entry:**

1. Identify the pattern (what went wrong, repeatedly?)
2. Write a rule (imperative, actionable)
3. Add rule to the appropriate guide file
4. Remove the raw entry from this file

## Distilled

| Pattern | Rule added to |
|----|----|
| Stale reads | `always.md` — "Re-read before editing" |
| Wrong year/path assumptions | `always.md` — "Verify Before Writing" |
| Tool failure deflection | `workarounds.md` — "Tool Failure Recovery" |
| Incomplete rename | `workflow.md` — "Rename with mv, then search" |
| Project-specific swap | `workflow.md` — "Remove, don't swap" |
| Worktree paths | `always.md` — already covered in "All file paths" |
| Drifting from requirements | `always.md` — "Requirements Echo" |
| Ignoring shorthand | `always.md` — "Shorthand First" |
| Revisit as info not action | `shorthand.md` — revisit now includes "ask Work on?" |
| Incomplete journal | `shorthand.md` — journal now says "Execute ALL parts" |
| Contradicted self | `always.md` — "Before saying No, verify" |
| Misread exact name | `always.md` — "Exact names matter" |
| Checked off without testing | `always.md` — "Code written ≠ feature complete" |
| Asked which task first | `always.md` — "Task lists are priority-ordered" |
| Used Bash ls instead of Glob/Read | `always.md` — "Use Glob/Read, not Bash" |
| Speculated instead of observing | `pitfalls.md` #12 — "Observe before speculating" |
| Abbreviated code names | `pitfalls.md` #13 — "No abbreviations in code" |
| Misread "here" as file reference | `pitfalls.md` #14 — "'Here' means chat output" |
| Wrote to Claude memory dir | `CLAUDE.md` — already added |
| Worktree paths (repeated) | `pitfalls.md` #7 — already covered |
| npm instead of yarn (repeated) | `always.md` — already covered |
| Skipped always.md reads (repeated) | `CLAUDE.md` — already covered |
| Miscounted entries (stale read) | `pitfalls.md` #1 — already covered |
| Ignored shorthand command (repeated) | `pitfalls.md` #8 — already covered |
| Logged without checking existing rules | `pitfalls.md` #15 — already covered |
