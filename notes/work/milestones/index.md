# Milestones

**Started:** 2026-01-05 | **Status:** milestone 1 achieved

## Problem

Project history lives in my head. No quick way to see how we got here or what the major turning points were. Future me (or anyone else) would have to dig through commits and docs to reconstruct the journey. Plus i intend this project to lean into creating at all levels of abstraction. Creativity is gold.

## Goal

A living roadmap: origin story, major milestones with context and outcomes, template pattern for other projects.

## Origin

Twenty years ago, I wrote a CAD program for Mac. No iPhone yet, no tablets. The marketplace favored Windows. Marketing cost more than revenue could support. I count it as success—return rate under 1%, and I loved using it.

Two decades on, no CAD software has matched its power. I'm eager to recreate my baby with modern tools, then play to my heart's content. Heavy use of Claude, perhaps 100% AI-written code. I've stumbled upon an extraordinarily effective usage pattern—expect 3x the development rate of webseriously, less stress, longer hours. This document is part of that pattern.

## Milestones

### 1 -- Project Creation

**Timeline:** **Jan 4-5, 2025** | [details](m.1.solid.foundation.md)

**Goal:** Put this project on its feet with a proof of concept for 3D rendering and user interaction.

**Outcome:** Working quaternion demo, dev environment (Vite + Svelte 5 + TypeScript + vitest), documentation system, workflow that survives across sessions, style guide for consistency.

### 2 -- Next Action

Add milestone 2 when appropriate.
