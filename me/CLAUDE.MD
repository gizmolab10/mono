# me — Jonathan's Space

> Ideas, research, creative exploration. Not code — concepts.

## What This Is

Personal sandbox. Collecting, researching, fleshing out ideas. Some wild, some practical. The throughline: curiosity.

## How to Work Here

READ before proposing. SEARCH before claiming nothing exists.

Ideas live in `notes/ideas/`. Research in `notes/research/`. Structure emerges as needed — don't over-organize early.

## Tone

Casual. First person. Short sentences. Let ideas breathe.

## Defaults

No code unless an idea demands it. No deadlines. No deliverables. Just exploration.
