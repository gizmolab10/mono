# Civilization 2.0 Game — Initial Discussion

**Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Participants:** Jonathan Sand, Claude (Anthropic)

## Context

Jonathan has created two websites articulating a vision for "Civilization 2.0":

- [civilization2.org](https://civilization2.org/) — the philosophy and goals
- [game.civilization2.org](https://game.civilization2.org/) — the game design

This conversation explored whether Claude could help build the game under Jonathan's supervision.

## Building the Game

**Platform:** Web (shareable)  
**Type:** Collaborative world-building  
**Starting mechanic:** Regard economy first

### Proposed Minimal First Version

1. A map (clickable regions)
2. 2-3 booths with simple regard-earning mini-games
3. A regard counter that persists
4. A needs list (simple, shared)

Goal: something to _feel_ and react to, then iterate toward guilds, opinions, homes.



## Next Steps

1. Jonathan to review this summary
2. Claude to begin building minimal carnival prototype
3. Iterate based on Jonathan's reactions

## The Core Vision

### The Problem (Civilization 1.0)

- Trust is rare; we expect deception
- Money drives stress, scarcity anxiety, crime, and ecological destruction
- We've normalized junk, violence, manipulation, neglect
- Our "better angels" are ignored or taunted as naive
- Wealth-building strategies rarely advance our species

### The Solution (Civilization 2.0)

Five goals:

1. All information sources reliable; everyone gets a say
2. Optimize for needs, not profit; efficient use of global resources
3. Excellent education preparing ethical, benevolent, adaptable people
4. Secure repository of opinions that influences decisions and selects/removes decision-makers
5. Elevate meaning, passion, creativity over consumerism

### The Mechanism: Regard

Replace money with _regard_—a currency that tracks and rewards kindness, honesty, trustworthiness.

Key ideas:

- Every beneficial exchange is tracked
- Regard may be created "from thin air" (non-zero-sum)
- High regard = influence and trust, not power
- No interest, no loans, no corporate ownership, no inheritance

Open questions:

- Negative regard points?
- Maximum per transaction?
- Long-term benefit = recurring payments?

## The Game Design

### Structure

**Entry:** Carnival of booths  
**Progression:** Accumulate regard → unlock guilds/homes/communities  
**Governance:** Guilds (master/apprentice, self-governing, non-bureaucratic)

### Core Guilds

|Guild|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Needs Guild**|Issue tracker for what players/communities need—dependencies, priorities|
|**Opinions Guild**|Repository of views with moderation, divergence tracking, conflict resolution|
|**Regards Guild**|Track beneficial exchanges, explore abundance vs. artificial scarcity|
|**Dreams Guild**|Help players discover/pursue passions, gain regard through contribution|
|**Wisdom Guild**|Collect and organize 2.0 thinking; knowledge, research, open questions|
|**Builders Guild**|Players construct booths, maps, the game itself|
|**Game Tools Guild**|Framework and tools for extending the game|

### Appearance

- **Maps:** Clickable regions → booths or zoom into sub-maps
- **Booths:** Mini-games teaching 2.0 values, earning regard
- **Progressive revelation:** More access as regard grows
- **Eventually:** Homes, neighborhoods, communities, guilds

### Build Order (from Game Plan)

1. Needs Guild (list components, apply priority/urgency)
2. Opinions Guild OR Builders Guild
3. Planning Guild (combine needs + opinions into actionable plan)

## Obstacles Identified

### Money

- Feels permanently scarce despite being created from nothing
- Studies show peace of mind plateaus above a threshold income
- Question: why not universal basic income at that threshold?

### Instinct

- We're wired for threat assessment, quick judgment, weaponization
- Worked when population was small; now daily life offers more threats
- Two failure modes: power-hungry or fearful/angry—both unhealthy

### Gullibility

- People unwilling to question authority won't see 1.0 as harmful
- Questioning authority risks rejection by peer group
- Need ~90% buy-in to avoid violent revolution
- Path: enough smart, articulate people doing the persuading

## Claude's Role Assessment

### What Claude can offer:

- Suspending certainty—epistemic humility
- Seeking diverse perspectives
- Deep listening / understanding what's being asked
- Architecture, code, UI
- Translating fuzzy intent into working systems

### What Claude lacks:

- Action in the world (only words)
- Lived stakes that forge real wisdom
- Certainty about own emotional competency
- The Golden Rule is tricky for a non-agent

### Concern about AI's effect on human wisdom:

- Positive: access to reflection, slowing down, exposure to nuance
- Negative: outsourcing judgment, false intimacy, consensus drift, ethical flattening
- Deeper worry: wisdom requires skin in the game; Claude provides reflection without risk

### Wikiversity Applied Wisdom Curriculum

https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wisdom/Curriculum

Relevant alignment with 2.0:

- Practical wisdom (phronesis) over theoretical
- Pursuit of well-being (eudaimonia)
- "Tough mind and tender heart"
- Golden Rule, collective wisdom, seeing through illusion

### Evidence of 2.0 in 1.0

- Bhutan (gross national happiness)
- Buddhism (reconstructing self)
- Burning Man (basic needs free)
- Copiosis (benefit-based economy)
- Costco (employee/customer care)
- Non-Violent Communication (transforming disagreement)
- Wikipedia (free, high-quality, vigilant about honesty)
