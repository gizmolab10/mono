# Maturity Guidance — Proposal

## The problem

AI is accelerating the churn. We build fast, we build alone, and we reinvent constantly. The same authentication system, the same state management pattern, the same deployment pipeline — rebuilt from scratch a thousand times over. Not because the old ones were bad, but because nobody could find them, trust them, or plug them in.

## The idea

An ecosystem that gets people to build toward each other. Small, universally adaptable pieces — assessed for maturity, guided by a council, and delivered through a process that favors benevolence, curiosity, and leniency over rigidity.

Think of it as pattern-making for software. APIs are the memes — the repeatable units that spread because they're simple enough to adopt and good enough to trust.

## What we'd build

### 1. Maturity assessment

A framework for evaluating where a project sits in its lifecycle. Not a gate — a mirror. The checklist:

- Minimal bugs and code debt
- Rich feature set
- UX: well reasoned, self-consistent, familiar look and feel
- Integration with other related pieces
- Saves time
- Fulfills an obvious and strong need
- General purpose
- Awesome customer support

Projects don't need to score perfectly. The assessment tells you what's solid and what's not, so adopters can decide for themselves.

### 2. Council

A small group (Steve, Pete, others) who provide guidance, wisdom, and an approval process for new guidelines and APIs. Not gatekeepers — shepherds. Their job:

- Evaluate submitted pieces against the maturity framework
- Approve, suggest revisions, or flag concerns
- Guide projects in trouble
- Protect the ecosystem from malicious behavior

The bias is toward inclusion. Creativity leads. No rigidity.

### 3. Request / evaluate / deliver process

The engine that connects builders to each other:

- **Request:** Someone identifies a need — "we need a better date picker" or "every project rolls their own auth"
- **Evaluate:** The council (with AI assistance) reviews existing solutions, assesses maturity, and identifies the best candidate or gap
- **Deliver:** Matched builders get access to each other. Small pieces, promised deliverables, universally adaptable

AI plays a resource role here — scanning, matching, summarizing — but humans make the calls.

### 4. Standards and patterns

Best practices for development, framed as guidelines not rules:

- What to standardize and when
- Submit, approve, reject flow (with meetings as needed)
- Fun, curiosity, flex and adapt as core values

The patterns should be simple enough to repeat. That's the whole point — if a pattern can't spread on its own, it's too complicated.

### 5. Product / service layer

Guide you to the best tool for your needs. Not a marketplace — a matchmaker. You describe what you're building, and the system connects you to mature, adaptable pieces and the people behind them.

## Values

These run through everything:

- **Adaptability** over standardization
- **Benevolence** over competition
- **Curiosity** over convention
- **Leniency** over gatekeeping
- **Wisdom** over speed

And the hard ones: leave ample room for breakdowns. Systems fail. People fail. The ecosystem should absorb that gracefully, not punish it.

## Next steps

- [ ] Share with council members (Steve, Pete) for feedback
- [ ] Define the maturity assessment as a usable tool (interactive checklist? scorecard?)
- [ ] Sketch the request/evaluate/deliver flow
- [ ] Market research — who else is trying this, what worked, what didn't
- [ ] Prototype the product/service matchmaker
