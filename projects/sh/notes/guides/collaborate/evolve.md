# Evolving the UI

Organic, not planned. Small perturbations, easy to test.

## The Journey


1. **Structure** — Layout, padding, gaps, dynamic stretching
2. **Constants** — Make hand-tweaking easy (faster than asking AI)
3. **Color** — Tweak until it feels relaxing to the eye
4. **Wire** — Connect buttons to actions
5. **Play** — Use it, notice friction, add feedback (hover works well)
6. **Refine** — Persistence, edge cases, make it feel natural

## Lessons

* Stay simple, each piece added should not increase overall complexity
* Fewer containers = simpler math = fewer bugs
* CSS flex beats manual width calculations
* Nurture the *feeling*, does it feel natural, intuitive, helpful?
